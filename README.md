This is the source code for my LED music visualizer project.

##Installation

To properly compile this sketch, you need to copy the contents of the `libraries` folder to your Arduino's `libraries`
folder. See [the Arduino library guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) for more detailed instructions on that.

The code supports strips of different widths and heights. A few other parameters are easily adjustible. The only
restriction is that the number of bars must be a power of 2.
